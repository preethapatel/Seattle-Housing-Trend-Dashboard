# Seattle-Housing-Trend-Dashboard
Below is a Tableau Dashboard project done as an excercise to practice functions and learn a more challenging project from Data with Mo on Youtube. Here is my writeup on why these functions are useful for data analysis, and the types of questions it prompted me to ask.
Within this project, I learned the following functions and the importance when creating visualizations:

Graph Types:

**Line Chart**: This shows a general trend in prices per day. It helps us to look into why certain dates are more expensive than others, which could allude to implications such as peak seasons or economic fluctuation. It makes us question, what caused such drastic change in prices, or what are the projected future price ranges?

**Heat Map**: This shows the color range of average home prices, and the increase in color shade indicates higher price. This visualization provides an easier, eye catching way to analyze expensive versus cheaper areas.

**Histogram of Distribution of Prices:** This is a good way to see affordability and indicate what class of population lives in the area. It can help connect to questions such as “Is this affordable compared to the wages earned?”, “How expensive is the housing in this area, and why?”, “Does this indicate there is a shortage in affordable housing?”

**Histogram of Bedroom and Bathroom count:** These graphs can be connected to the price. Is the pricing fair in relation to the bedroom and bathroom price? Also this can help indicate whether there are lots of houses open for families, a couple, or single individuals. How challenging can they expect their house search to be?

**Heatmap of Housing Condition:** This helps us analyze how much the house condition and the views impact each other in their price. In some cases, there isn’t a clear one way trend where the lower the condition, the lower the price, and vice versa. There are many factors that can affect this, including the size of the house and how old it is. It can also depend on the area it is in, or even simply how much the owners think is fair. However we can conclude that the general trend is the better the condition of the house, the more it will cost an individual.

**Calendar Heatmap:**

Features were added to filter Sqft Lot, Sqft Living, and Yr Built. Another filter is added on the Dashboard to see trends in each month from May 2014- May 2015. Do the dates matter for price? Which dates are cheaper than others, or which months are? During the cheaper and expensive points, what was going on in the housing market? If we want to make it more challenging we can think about if this is only exclusive to the state or if its a national issue.

Added features to improve visualization:

**Color:**

As I was experimenting with colors, I found some are hard to see with versus others. The goal of data visualization is to make it appealing and easy to the eye, so the reader isn’t working harder to understand what is presented. For example, since there were heat charts in this dashboard, selecting a lighter color shade to be the darkest end point isn’t effective because the generated hues will be too similar to tell the difference. Instead, using a very dark shade such as blues or greens, or even bright colors, but making sure its not too bright to be too overwhelming, helps create more of a gap with the hue shades. 

**Filters:** 

This helps to make data easier to digest and break it down and answer some of the questions above. If the data trends were shown only for the year instead of breaking it up by month, week, and day, it is harder to understand the market and makes findings very vague. There are numerous factors to take into account, because they are all intertwined. This data can help home builders determine where certain population needs may be, how big to make the houses, how affordable they should be, in what areas should they be built in, and even how the economy will impact their prices versus other contractors or even locations. It helps provide better justification for a price and how to market their homes, thus saving money in their efforts as well as a better understanding of their target audience. The more a company understands its market the better the returns will be. As for the buyer, this data can help them determine what is financially viable for them, and if this meets their needs. What location are they looking at and what can they expect for size, view, price, and condition?
